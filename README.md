# Automated Experimental Setup for Low-Temperature Testing of Electronic Components Using Liquid Nitrogen

This repository contains the design and implementation of an automated experimental setup for testing electronic components at low temperatures using liquid nitrogen. Developed within the framework of the DUNE-UdeA collaboration, the project focuses on creating a reliable and efficient system for conducting cryogenic tests on various electronic devices.

The setup is composed of two main stages:

1. **Data Acquisition and Control System**: The data acquisition system collects and logs temperature and other critical data during testing. The control system regulates the immersion cycle of the electronic components into liquid nitrogen, ensuring precise timing and temperature control.

2. **Robotic Arm for Immersion**: A custom-built robotic arm immerses and withdraws electronic components into and from the liquid nitrogen chamber. This automated mechanism allows for controlled and repeatable testing procedures, ensuring proper exposure to the required low temperatures.

The project includes hardware designs, control algorithms, and data acquisition scripts to fully automate the testing process, optimizing the performance of electronic devices under extreme conditions.
